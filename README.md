In this project, the class is going to break into groups and build an "About Me" website. 

Each group will consist of 2-5 students and every member will be tasked with creating their own web page that displays some fun information about themselves.
If you feel uncomfortable with creating an "About Me" page, then you are free to create a web page about a topic of your interest. Please make sure the topic does not violate any university student guidelines. 

The purpose of this project is not so much to create some beautiful website, but to familiarize yourself with using git and GitHub in a group setting. This project will force you to learn common git commands that will be used to collaborate with your team. You will also be tasked with learning how to create a simple static webpage using HTML, CSS, and some JavaScript. 

Every group will have the autonomy to decide what technologies they would like to use for styling their webpage. You can use simple CSS or choose to import any other styling library like Styled Components, Tailwind CSS or MUI. 

GOALS:

-	Become comfortable working with other developers in a group setting.
-	learn how to use basic git commands i.e. create branches or make pull and push requests. 
-	Create a static website utilizing HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
